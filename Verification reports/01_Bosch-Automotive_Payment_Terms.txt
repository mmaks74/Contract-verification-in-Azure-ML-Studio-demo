Based on the information you have provided, it seems that the Payment Terms Clause is not directly included in the excerpts from the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Consequently, we will need to craft or adjust a Payment Terms Clause in line with the suggested elements for a comprehensive payment structure outlined in your message. 

Here are specific recommendations for crafting an effective Payment Terms Clause based on your points:

1. **Payment Amount**: 
   - Clearly state the exact amount to be paid. For example: "The total payment amount shall be $[Exact Amount]."
   - Provide a detailed breakdown of costs, specifying itemized services (e.g., consulting services, materials, taxes, and any applicable fees).

2. **Due Date**:
   - Clearly define the payment due date. For example: "Payment shall be due within [Number] days upon receipt of the invoice."
   - Include deadlines for any partial payments, if applicable. Specify clear terms, such as: "Partial payments shall be made in accordance with the following schedule: [e.g., 50% upon signing, 50% due [date]].‚Äù

3. **Payment Method**:
   - List accepted methods of payment: "Payments can be made via bank transfer, credit card, PayPal, or other mutually agreed methods." Ensure these match with typical practices in the industry or your past agreements.
   - Include necessary payment details, e.g., "Bank transfer payments should be made to the following account: [Bank Account Information]."

4. **Late Payment Penalties**: 
   - Specify late fees or interest charges. For example: "Any late payments will incur a penalty of [specify late fee, e.g., 1.5% per month on overdue amounts]." Ensure that this fee is reasonable and in accordance with the standard practices in the industry.
   - Detail the application process for late fees and any grace periods: "A grace period of [Number] days will be allowed for late payments before the penalty is applied."

5. **Early Payment Discounts**: 
   - Define any early payment discounts clearly: "A discount of [X%] will be available if payment is received within [Number] of days after delivery of the invoice."
   - Clearly state the conditions under which the discount applies: "To qualify for the early payment discount, the full amount must be paid by the due date specified in the invoice."

6. **Consistency Check**: 
   - Ensure that this clause aligns with the overall agreement and does not conflict with any other sections of the contract. Review the entire contract to make sure there are no contradictory clauses.

Here's an example of how a Payment Terms Clause could look after incorporating these adjustments:
